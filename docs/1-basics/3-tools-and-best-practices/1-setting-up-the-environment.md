# Setting up the environment

To write and run JavaScript we only need a text editor and a runtime such as a web browser for graphical applications or a command line JavaScript engine such as Node.js or Deno for console applications.

## Web browser

All modern web browsers are capable of running JavaScript code. The most popular browsers are [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/hu-hu/edge), and [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/hu/firefox/). These browsers are mostly similar in their features and can be used for the purpose of running your JavaScript code.

Within web browsers there are quite a few useful features for writing and testing code. Together we call these developer tools or **DevTools**. In most browsers we can open the DevTools by pressing the `F12` key. It is also possible to open DevTools from the menu of browsers (e.g. *More tools > Developer tools* in Microsoft Edge).

## Command line runtimes

With the release of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) in 2009 it became possible to run JavaScript code outside of a browser in a command line environment. Since Node.js a several other similar runtimes emerged. For the purpose of using JavaScript as an educational programming language we recommend [Deno](https://deno.com/).

Deno is similar to Node.js but it supports TypeScript out of the box, and it is built on web standards. It also makes handling standard input and reading files much easier compared to Node.js.

## Code editor

JavaScript code is just plain text so it can be written with any text editor. However it is recommended to use a dedicated code editor that has syntax highlighting and other code editing features for at least JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Many free and open source editors are available, but we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Visual Studio Code is free and easy to use, it is available for all platforms, and has a lot of useful extensions.

:::tip
While full fledged Integrated Development Environments (IDE) are also available, these are not necessary for learning programming. If you still wish to use a more advanced tool, the widely used [JetBrains WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) is free for educational use.
