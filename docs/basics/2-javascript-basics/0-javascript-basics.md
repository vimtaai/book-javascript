# JavaScript Basics

JavaScript is an **interpreted script language**. This means that the program code runs directly in a **runtime** without a separate compilation step (aka. JIT or "just-in-time" compilation). This runtime can be a graphical interface such as a web browser (e.g. Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge) or a desktop environment (e.g. Electron), or it can be a command-line environment (e.g. Node.js, Deno, Bun). Each of these runtimes uses a **JavaScript engine** to run JavaScript code as well as their own APIs (programming interfaces).

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm programming language, which means that it supports a variety of programming styles and paradigms, such as **imperative**, **functional**, and **object-oriented**. While it is possible to use a single paradigm exclusively, the true power of JavaScript is the ability to combine these various programming styles.

The multi-paradigm nature of JavaScript makes it ideal for showcasing and combining multiple programming paradigms and approaches for students.
