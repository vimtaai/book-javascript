# Introduction

## About the author

The main author of this Guide is **Márton Visnovitz**, Hungarian software developer with a background in computer science, environmental science and education. His PhD research focused on using web programming and web technologies as a means of teaching programming in school and on a university level.

## Goals

The primary audience of this guide are **teachers teaching programming and students who want to learn the basics of coding**. It provides **educational journeys** using web technologies, mainly the JavaScript programming language. These are presented in the Part II of this Guide are intended as separate approaches to learn programming, not as consecutive topics to master. Choosing one of journeys based on the student's preferences, needs and interests helps creating a more enjoyable and effective learning experience.

When creating this guide we followed three core principles:

- **Learning-focused**: The goal is to learn, and we always put the learner's and the educator's needs in focus. We are not training coders.
- **Modern**: Tech solutions we present follow the most modern best practices. No age-old, outdated techniques.
- **Real-life**: Programming principles and practices presented follow real-life usage examples. We do it as an expert would.

## Structure

**Part I** contains information about the core concepts of developing software in a web environment. This includes an introduction to the basics of the Web, how it works, its fundamental principles and technologies, along with a guide for the basics of the JavaScript programming language. This section is intended to be used as a reference rather than as a learning material. Instead of going through the information presented here, start with one of the learning journeys presented in the Part II.

**Part II** includes various learning journeys to choose from. With the exception of the "[Developing Applications][2a]" journey, little to no prerequisite knowledge is required to get started. Each journey builds on a different approach/strategy to teach and learn programming. Choosing either of these will cover the basics of programming and various programming topics, but each also includes pieces of knowledge that are unique to the specific learning journey.

Several **exercises** are also present in each journey. Some of these are included to practice a specific piece of new knowledge, while some serve as complex problems to apply the knowledge gained throughout the whole learning experience. Throughout this guide we include relevant **references** to external sources, such as links to documentation pages and other resources. We also include figures, code examples and side notes about more advanced topics. Some additional information is also presented for educational consideration in the form of side-notes.

While this Guide is available in a "book" format as well, it is intended to be a "living" document, continuously improved, revised, and updated. Regular fixes and updates are planned in the future.

## Acknowledgement

This Guide is based on and is a spiritual successor the Hungarian language teacher's handbook web programming <span lang="hu">"Böngésző mint alkalmazásfejlesztési platform"</span> (ISBN 978-963-284-993-5) from 2017. This Guide serves as both an English version, a revision, and an extension with a new and modern pedagogical approach.
